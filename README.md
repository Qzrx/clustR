clustR
======

A terrible/na√Øve attempt at a zero-research clustering algorithm. That I came up with in the shower.

Having no background in clustering algorithms, I got to thinking about how they might work--I came up with this and wanted to get it down in code to see just where the problems may arise and how I might go about fixing them.
